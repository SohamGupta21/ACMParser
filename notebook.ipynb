      "to see if simply placing such traffic in UDP headers disadvantages\n",
      "it. In this section, based on the copycat data presented above, we\n",
      "discuss lessons learned.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, UDP provides a viable common basis for new transport\n",
      "protocols, but only in cases where alternatives exist on access\n",
      "networks where UDP connectivity is unavailable or severely com-\n",
      "promised. QUIC provides a good illustration here. It was developed\n",
      "together with SPDY, which has been defined over TCP and TLS\n",
      "as HTTP/2 [1], and its first target application is HTTP/2. Since\n",
      "HTTP/2 has a natural fallback to TLS over TCP, this alternative\n",

      "QUIC’s applicability to application layer protocols that can be made\n",
      "run acceptably over TCP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the dataset collected with copycat provides evidence\n",
      "that the vast majority of UDP impairments are access-network\n",

      "curate fallback decisions are easy to arrive at – a connection racing\n",
      "design similar to Happy Eyeballs [27] as used by QUIC is sufficient –\n",
      "and can often be cached based on client access network as opposed\n",
      "on access-network/server pair.\n",

      "We made no attempt to confirm claims of defensive rate-limiting\n",

This paper introduces copycat, generic transport protocol test- ing tool highlights differential treatment path terms connectivity QoS TCP non-TCP transport pro- tocol. copycat generates TCP-shaped traffic custom headers, compares performance terms loss delay TCP. We present proof-of-concept case study (UDP vs. TCP) order answer questions deployability current transport evolution approaches, demonstrate extent copycat’s capabilities possible applications. While vast majority UDP impairments found access-network linked, subtle impairment rare, middleboxes might adapt new protocols would perform differently wild compared early deployments controlled environment testing.

Indeed, ubiquity stability TCP common facility handles hard problems reliability congestion control key factor led massive growth Internet. However, every application benefits single-stream, fully-reliable service provided TCP. In addition, ubiquitous deployment network address translators (NATs) firewalls understand limited set protocols make new protocols difficult deploy. Previous attempts deploy new protocols SCTP [21] hindered ossification [8], well difficulty rapid deployment new kernel code across multiple platforms. The deployment middleboxes “understand” TCP also limit ability deploy new TCP options features [9]. Much design work Multipath TCP [4, 5], example, addressed middlebox detection avoidance. This led current trend transport protocol design use UDP encapsulation solve problem. Google’s QUIC [6] WebRTC data channel [10] use UDP outer transport protocol. In cases, transport protocol dynamics (connec- tion establishment, reliability, congestion control, transmission scheduling) handled inner protocol. In case WebRTC data channel, SCTP Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [26]; case QUIC, QUIC transport protocol itself. This new kind encapsulation. In contrast traditional tunneling, approach borrows “wire image” UDP two key benefits: userspace deployability new trans- ports, due ubiquitous availability UDP sockets unpriv- ileged, userspace programs; NAT/firewall traversal, devices recognize UDP ports. The Path Layer UDP Substrate (PLUS) effort within IETF [25] generalizes approach new transport protocols. This situation pleads protocol deployability performance assessment. To end, widespread methodology consists implementing new protocols network simulators investigate characteristics. While solution advantageous, provides partial view way actual network behaves far theoretical view provided simulators. Therefore, paper, advocate “in-the-wild” protocol testing addition simulations controlled environments introduce novel measurement tool called copycat.1 It aims evaluating experimental protocols’ deployability, extensibil- ity existing ones comparing processing network, terms connectivity performance, regular TCP con- nections. 1Sources freely available https://github.com/mami-project/copycat 13 \\x0cANRW ’17, July 15, 2017, Prague, Czech Republic K. Edeline et al. copycat creates TCP traffic another protocol’s (UDP non-UDP) wire image, performs full-mesh measurements test networks order determine differential treatment experimental protocols’ TCP packets might disadvantage non- TCP congestion-controlled traffic. copycat generic allows testing wide variety transport protocols without need actually implement them. It thus suitable immediate de- ployment distributed measurement testbed. It also eases network traces analysis working TCP-controlled flows. To demonstrate copycat capabilities, investigate UDP vs. TCP scenario deploying copycat PlanetLab cloud provider Digital Ocean [3]. In summary, see evidence com- plete blocking UDP 2% 4% terrestrial ac- cess networks, find blocking primarily linked ac- cess network; results line reported QUIC per- formance [22]. We note networks uniformly distributed throughout Internet: UDP impairment especially concentrated enterprise networks networks geographic regions otherwise-challenged connectivity. Where UDP work terrestrial access networks, see evidence systematic impairment traffic UDP headers. The strategy taken current efforts encapsulate new transports UDP therefore fundamentally sound. The remainder paper organized follows: Sec. 2 po- sitions work regarding state art; Sec. 3 describes copycat implementation use it; Sec. 4 demonstrates copycat capabilities UDP vs. TCP use case; finally, Sec. 5 concludes work summarizing main achievements 2 RELATED WORK Many network measurement tools proposed eval- uate reachability transport protocol performance analysis. Netalyzr [12] determines whether particular service, identified port number transport protocol, reachable. iPerf [23] computes maximum achievable bandwidth alongside QoS metrics TCP, UDP, SCTP. tbit [14] infers impact current network environment TCP behavior. Happy Eyeballs algorithm [27] helps dual-stack applications choose network protocol use IPv4 IPv6 avoiding connectivity problems, select appropriate supported transport proto- cols [17]. More recently, PATHspider [13] performs A/B testing identify path transparency impairments. Sarma evaluates TCP UDP performances simulation particular context (QoS) considering two queuing mechanisms: RED Drop Tail [20]. Bruno et al. develop models analyzing measuring UDP/TCP throughput WiFI networks [2]. While results provide insights background knowledge aspects UDP well TCP performance, cannot used answer question differential treatment two proto- cols Internet (covering different access network technologies), unlike copycat. Hätönen et al. [7] investigate differential treatment NATs. They look NAT timeouts variety 34 home gateway devices available 2010, found median idle timeout bidirectional UDP traffic 3 minutes, minimum timeout 30 seconds. In contrast, median idle timeout TCP 60 minutes, minimum 5 minutes. Network transport-layer performance general well- studied field: Qian et al. [19] look characteristics measured TCP traffic. Paxson et al. [18] focuses packet dynamics TCP bulk transfers limited set Internet sides. Pahdye et al. [16] investigate TCP behavior web servers, assuming in- terference network. Xu al. [28] use UDP-based traffic evaluate characteristics cellular networks. They also test TCP throughput ensure UDP throttling performed tested network would tamper results. Melia et al. [15] evaluate TCP UDP performance IPv6-based mobile envi- ronment. Packet encapsulation network measurements employed copycat common technique, well, particularly middlebox identification. For instance, TCPExposure [9] client sends TCP packets raw IP sockets toward user controlled server. The server sends back received to-be-sent headers payload client compare sent received. copycat first attempt directly evaluate performance differences congestion-controlled, reliable traffic based solely wire image (i.e., whether TCP, UDP, another protocol header seen traffic network). 3 COPYCAT In section, introduce copycat, generic, multiplat- form, lightweight connectivity Quality Service (QoS) differential treatment measurement tool. It able compare many different protocols statelessly without implement write code. It supports multiple operating systems, PlanetLab-compliant, minimizes overhead introduced tunneling. copycat simultaneously runs pairs flows two end- points, one reference TCP flow one TCP flow using custom header “outer” transport, evaluate differences connectivity QoS due differential treatment based transport protocol. This tunneled TCP flow emulates wire image new protocol network retains TCP traffic characteristics enable valid comparison two tested flows. The two flows run parallel exact 4-tuples, obtain flows similar possible treatment network apart middleboxes, different trans- port headers. By comparing performances two flows, able isolate differences attributed differential treatment path. copycat encapsulation details shown Fig. 1. Reference refers regular TCP flow used groundtruth flow per- formance comparison, Experimental custom flow, TCP-controlled tunneled IP TCP headers, whose outer encapsulation, entirely specified command lines. It UDP header, plus optional additional header placed inside UDP datagram, tunneled headers. This encapsulation used testing varieties protocols relying UDP (e.g., PLUS [25], QUIC [11]). Or also custom, non-UDP trans- port header IP protocol number. This encapsulation 14 \\x0ccopycat: Testing Differential Treatment New Transport Protocols Wild Figure 1: copycat encapsulations. Figure 2: copycat measurement methodology. used stateless testing many IP transport protocols (DCCP [11], native SCTP [21], UDP options [24]). As shown Fig. 2, custom flow obtained tunneling TCP flow. To achieve this, copycat first creates tun virtual net- work interface simulates network layer device operates Layer 3. In measurement setup, node runs copycat client server. On client side, TCP client connects peer via Internet-facing interface receives data it, writing disk. The custom client consists TCP client bound tun interface, turn bound copycat either UDP raw socket Internet-facing interface. copycat thus works tunnel endpoint, encapsulating TCP packets tun UDP custom headers, decapsulat- ing received UDP custom packets back TCP packets tun. The server-side consists similar arrangement, listening con- nections clients sending data them. The client waits transfers, via TCP TCP-controlled UDP custom protocol, completed connecting next destination. copycat offers modularity allowing user configure multiple parameters role node (client, server, both), flow scheduling, IP version. The flow sched- uling either run reference experimental flows parallel run one completely finished, sequentially. The IP version either IPv4, IPv6, both. For 15 ANRW ’17, July 15, 2017, Prague, Czech Republic latter, clients opens two pairs flow instead one, first consists IPv6 reference flow IPv4 experimental flow second IPv4 reference flow IPv6 experimental flow. A copycat measurement campaign involves two types actors: set servers hosting data form simple files set clients sequentially connecting server download files. The client server sets identical (See Sec. 4.1 complete case study). To avoid unwanted fragmentation ICMP message-too- long errors, ensure packets tunneled non-tunneled flows equally sized, Maximum Segment Size (MSS) tunneled TCP flow decreased size tunnel headers (IP header + transport headers). copycat coded C2 minimize tunneling overhead. I/O multiplexing handled using select(). All network traces captured internet-facing interface using libpcap clients servers. 4 UDP FOR INTERNET TRANSPORT EVOLUTION In section, show copycat find suitable usage comparing performance UDP encapsulation (i.e., TCP inside UDP) regular TCP. In particular, copycat, able determine whether UDP encapsulation work present Internet, connectivity performance UDP traffic disadvantaged respect TCP based presence UDP header. copycat used create TCP traffic UDP’s wire image, perform full-mesh measurements wide variety test networks, order determine differential treatment UDP TCP packets might disadvantage congestion- controlled traffic UDP headers. In particular, Sec. 4.1 explains measurements per- formed. Results (UDP blocking, throughput, initial latency) presented Sec. 4.2 Sec. 4.4. Finally, Sec. 4.5, discuss lessons learned case study. 4.1 Measurement Setup We tested viability UDP transport evolution copycat straightforwardly using UDP encapsulation mode extra header. We deployed copycat PlanetLab distributed testbed selecting 93 nodes (one per subnetwork) entire pool (153) available nodes March 6th April 23rd, 2016. The se- lected nodes located 26 countries across North America (44), Europe (29), Asia (13), Oceania (4), South America (3). Consid- ering PlanetLab port binding restrictions (e.g., 80, 8000, 53, 443 certain nodes), chose seven ports–53, 443, 8008, 12345, 33435, 34567, 54321– respectively DNS, HTTPS, HTTP alternate, common backdoor, Atlas UDP traceroute default, unused unassigned port, maximize routers policy diversity. For port pair nodes, generated flows different sizes. The smallest flow calibrated exceed TCP initial window size, ensure data segments sent once. 2See https://github.com/mami-project/copycat \\x0cANRW ’17, July 15, 2017, Prague, Czech Republic K.

The axes arranged geographic regions: North Amer- ica (NA), Europe (EU), Asia (AS), Oceania South America (O). The connectivity matrix PlanetLab nodes provided Fig. 3 sug- gests impairment access-network linked. One node blocks inbound outbound UDP traffic, TCP connectivity problems servers well. Otherwise, transient connectivity impairment shows clear dependency node, opposed path. Table 2 provides percentage probes never seen UDP connection but, least, one TCP connection. Statistics provided port, measured copycat PlanetLab. As shown, UDP blocked TCP small extend. UDP blocked in, roughly, 1% 5% probes. We observed two China-based nodes blocking UDP traffic one node also based China. This advocates fall-back mechanism running Internet UDP (i.e., switching back UDP-based encapsulation native TCP packets). Note quite large absence UDP connection port 443 (QUIC) mainly due PlanetLab port binding restrictions nodes without connectivity problem. Anecdotally, found one New Zealand node blocking UDP TCP traffic China-based nodes. 4.3 Throughput To evaluate impact transport-based differential treatment throughput, introduce relative throuдhput_bias metric pairs concurrent flows. This computed follows: throuдhput_bias = (throuдhputudp − throuдhputtcp ) min(throuдhputtcp, throuдhputudp ) × 100. (1) 4Node pool reduced 41 PlanetLab port 53 usage policies. 5Node pool reduced 55 PlanetLab port 443 usage policies. Figure 3: Connectivity bias among PlanetLab nodes, exclud- ing ports 53 443. Positive (blue) values mean UDP better-connected TCP. Black dots mean “no connectiv- ity” (for UDP TCP). Then, increase size flows arbitrary factors ob- serve impact differential treatment congestion-controlled traffic larger flows. Overall, generated 20 pairs flows 1, 3, 30 TCP initial windows, 10 pairs flows 300 1, 500 TCP initial windows, total 1,634,518 flows. We also deployed copycat 6 Digital Ocean (DO) nodes, lo- cated six countries across North America (2), Europe (3), Asia (1). Given less restrictive port binding policies restrictive bandwidth occupation policies, tested ports 80 8000 addition PlanetLab ports. For port, generated 20 pairs flows 1, 3, 30 TCP initial windows size May 2nd 12th, 2016. We repeated methodology IPv4 IPv6. This dataset consists 32,400 IPv4 31,366 IPv6 flows.3 Table 1 provides overview main results. In summary, show that, aside blocking UDP certain ports, well relatively rare blocking UDP traffic one thirty access networks, UDP relatively unimpaired Internet.

Positive values mean UDP higher throughput. DO IPv6 split two due lack enough values (see Table 1). Figure 6: UDP/TCP initial RTT _bias measured copycat (“DO” stands Digital Ocean). Positive values mean UDP faster. DO IPv6 split two due lack enough values (see Table 1). reacts per RTT loss input signal, actual loss rate could still different even similar throughput achieved. Here, understand loss percentage flow payload lost, computed sequence numbers. A value, instance, 10% losses means thus 10% flow payload lost. Generally speaking, loss encountered quite low, given small flows often large enough fully utilize measured bottleneck link. As expected based throughput observed, see significant loss difference PlanetLab Digital Ocean comparing TCP UDP, except 3.5% favor UDP largest flow size (6MB). However, inline slightly lower throughput caused slightly larger initial RTT, discussed next section. 4.4 Initial Latency Since copycat traffic congestion controlled, throughput influenced end-to-end latency. We use initial RTT measured TCP handshake baseline metric. In fashion throuдhput_bias (see Eqn. 1), introduce relative RTT _bias metric pair concurrent flows. This computed follows: RTT _bias = (RTTtcp − RTTudp ) min(RTTtcp, RTTudp ) × 100. (2) A positive value RTT _bias means UDP smaller initial latency (i.e., performs better TCP). A null value means UDP TCP flows share initial latency. The median latency bias also listed Table 1. For PlanetLab, latency bias flows initial RTT 50ms less slight bias towards higher latency UDP flows larger initial RTTs. For Digital Ocean also observed slight bias towards higher latency UDP IPv4 bias IPv6 (considering 27 flows larger RTT 50ms representative). This confirmed CDF shown Fig. 6. The 2% 1% biased flow pairs RTT _bias re- spectively lower -1% -10%. For Digital Ocean IPv4 campaign, 40% generated flows RTT _bias 1% 30% absolute value. The difference IPv4 IPv6 Figure 5: Relative throughput bias among PlanetLab nodes measured copycat. Positive (blue) values mean UDP higher throughput. A positive value throuдhput_bias means UDP higher throughput. A null value means UDP TCP flows share throughput. Fig. 4 provides global view throuдhput_bias. Dataset split flows < 200 KB/sec flows > 200KB/sec, except Digital Ocean IPv6, number measurements small representative. Table 1 gives size sub dataset relative median bias throughput latency. As observed, general, bias UDP TCP. For Digital Ocean dataset, non-null biases mostly evenly distributed favor disfavor UDP. In PlanetLab, observe extreme case TCP performs better UDP, 4% 2% highest throuдhput_bias absolute value respec- tively higher 1% 10%. As shown Fig. 5, extreme cases, represented dark red lines, endpoint-dependent. We also notice single probe UDP throughput better TCP (see Fig. 5). Consistently UDP connectivity bias (see Fig. 3), see evidence path dependency throughput. The loss rate congestion controlled traffic steady state, link fully utilized, mostly determined con- gestion control algorithm itself. Therefore, direct relation throughput loss.

Edeline et al. Digital Ocean appears due presence middlebox interfering IPv4 traffic, TCP UDP. This difference latency also explains slight throughput disadvantage seen previous section given latency results follow nearly shape initial RTT (see Fig. 6). 4.5 Lessons Learned In case study, asked question “is UDP viable basis and/or encapsulation deploying new transports Internet?”. We focused two aspects answer: connectivity differen- tial treatment TCP TCP-congestion-controlled UDP packets see simply placing traffic UDP headers disadvantages it. In section, based copycat data presented above, discuss lessons learned. First, UDP provides viable common basis new transport protocols, cases alternatives exist access networks UDP connectivity unavailable severely com- promised. QUIC provides good illustration here. It developed together SPDY, defined TCP TLS HTTP/2 [1], first target application HTTP/2. Since HTTP/2 natural fallback TLS TCP, alternative used 1 − 5% networks QUIC packets UDP blocked limited. However, fallback approach limits QUIC’s applicability application layer protocols made run acceptably TCP. Second, dataset collected copycat provides evidence vast majority UDP impairments access-network linked, subtle impairment rare. This means ac- curate fallback decisions easy arrive – connection racing design similar Happy Eyeballs [27] used QUIC sufficient – often cached based client access network opposed access-network/server pair. We made attempt confirm claims defensive rate-limiting UDP traffic work, would essence require UDP-based denial service attacks networks mea- surement. However, note Google reports reduction amount UDP rate limiting observed since begin- ning QUIC experiment [22]. This makes sense: rate limitation must necessarily adapt baseline UDP traffic volumes, poses limitation gradually increasing deployment UDP- based transport protocols. However, also indicates need work mechanisms UDP protocols augment denial- of-service protection afforded rate-limiting approaches. 5 CONCLUSION This paper introduced copycat, novel measurement tool detect differential treatment middleboxes new transport pro- tocols compared TCP. copycat generates TCP-shaped traffic custom headers compares standard TCP. One key feature copycat easily allows research evaluate transport connectivity also QoS charac- teristics (e.g., throughput, loss, delay) writing minimum amount code. copycat open-source freely available (see https://github.com/mami-project/copycat). To demonstrate copycat capabilities, focused simple straightforward question: “is UDP viable basis and/or encap- sulation deploying new transports Internet?”. From measurements, conclude UDP relatively unimpaired Internet, despite blocking UDP certain ports well relatively rare blocking UDP traffic certain access networks. This means that, indeed, running Internet UDP globally possible. Further, find impairments UDP-based traffic access-network linked. Therefore, simple dynamic fallback mech- anisms UDP-encapsulated transports viable approach work around vast majority impairments encountered. A node needs measure remember anything peers, connectivity Internet, determine fall back. copycat complements set existing measurement tools separate effects differential network treatment differences traffic characteristics new transport protocols using tunneling approach. We shown copycat applicable answer underlying measurement questions con- nectivity well QoS UDP encapsulation approach deployment new transports. Next perform testing access actual impairments prevalence impairments native deployment new protocols, enabling new possibilities transport evolution development advances fallback mechanisms.
